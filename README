This project includes the following programs:

numbers - command-line solver for the numbers game
letters - command-line solver for the letters game
gletters - python gtk solver for the letters game
tkletters - perl tk solver for the letters game

There is also the game/ directory which contains a very silly and unfinished
simulator for the countdown game.
